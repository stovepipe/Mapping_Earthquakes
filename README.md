# Mapping_Earthquakes
This analysis uses the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes from GeoJSON data. Using the Leaflet library, our end result will be to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request, creating interactivity for the earthquake data.
